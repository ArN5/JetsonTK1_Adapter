# JetsonTK1_Adapter
This small circuit board will allow you to access the I/O pins from the Jetson TK1. Convert from 2MM pitch into standard 2.54MM headers.
You will have access to the 12v, 5v, 3.3v 1.8v rails as well as two I2C ports. We used this module to interface various I2C sensors to our Jetson 
TK1 board.
